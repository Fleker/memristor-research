# [Compute Caches](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7920849)

## Notes
- Compute Caches use bit-line SRAM circuits to transform them into computational units
- Past systems were _near the cache_. This is in-place processing of existing cache elements.
- Modeled after Intel's SandyBridge
    - 8 cores, 3 cache layers, ring interconnect
    - 1.9x perf, 2.4x less energy
    - Applications can can do better
- Can support good data parallelization
- Small 8% area overhead
- Store operands in same bitline
- Requires some ISA updating
- Add Search and Compare operations
- Operating systems spend 50% time copying bulk data
    - ie. Fork, IPCs, VMs, FS, Network
- Applications
    - WordCount: Reads text file, builds dictionary
    - among others
- Use McPAT to do energy reading

## Summary
The authors introduce a caching system which enables computation to occur by moving operands together in the compilation process and adding a small amount of circuitry to occur. Through a handful of applications, they demonstrate strong improvements in performance and energy usage.

## Pros
The paper is very thorough, examining a number of commands and seeking out ways to improve real-world applications. I'm impressed by their breadth, enabling several different custom commands along with a variety of non-trivial applications that run with significant improvements.

## Cons
Their real-world applications are heavily focused on text processing rather than something that may be done at a larger scale that could benefit much more from in-compute memory. While reading a 50MB text file can be a bit faster, is that improvement noticeable to a person?

All of their examples show very good improvements, so I do wonder if they went further where they'd hit the limits of performance improvement.

Additionally, they focus their research on enhancing SRAM. If they went with some NVRAM architecture, what exactly would they need to change or could it be a drop-in replacement?
