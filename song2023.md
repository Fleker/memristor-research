## Notes
- Addressing speed problem
    - Avoid sense amplifier process error
        - Instead do ? Not sure.
    - Getting 3.3 MB/s
    - 0.4 pJ/bit-energy
- Very short, preliminary results
    - Physical board

abstract={In summary, we have successfully developed a detailed theoretical and experimental TRNG using high-frequency noise in 130-nm embedded RRAM. Binary bit sequences generated by our RRAM-based TRNG are evaluated through min-entropy and pass all the NIST SP 800-22 randomness tests. Moreover, it shows excellent temperature stability; thus, it can be applied in various harsh environments. The high-speed, low-power RRAM-based TRNG demonstrated here shows great potential for communication data security.},
