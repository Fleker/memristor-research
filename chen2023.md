abstract={Image information encryption is an essential research direction in symmetric cryptography. A new digital image cryptosystem is proposed in this paper. A 480-bit external key is used to generate an equivalent key by the chaotic map, and a pseudo-random matrix is produced by the computer's pseudo-random number generator to assist the image encryption. The image data processing uses the discrete logarithm-based arithmetic on the Galois field GF(257). The original plain image is transformed into a non-visual image by exponentiation and multiplication operations on the field. Then, the non-visual image is self-scrambled to obtain a cipher image. Since the assisted matrix used for each encryption is a pseudo-random matrix, even for the same plain image and the unchanged secret key, ciphers image produced in multiple encryptions are different for the image encryption system. Simulation experiments show that the cipher images are excellent in statistical characteristics, and the image cryptosystem has the advantages of high processing speed and high security intensity.},
