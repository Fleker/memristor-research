# [Applications and limitations of memristive implication logic](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6331438)

## Notes
- Memristor boolean algebra can be performed by sequencing a few material implication operations
    - Requires external circuitry

## Summary
The authors introduce the concepts of executing boolean arithmetic in memristor architectures. In this paper, they introduce the concept, provide circuit diagrams, and explain the effects on volage systems in order to create a variety of boolean operations.

## Pros
One of the first memristor-imply papers, the authors do a good job explaining the circuit behaviors as well as providing high-quality diagrams as reference. They also do a good job of discussing the limitations of these circuits.

## Cons
The paper is very solid as reference but doesn't really do much in terms of development. They outline the circuitry and behaviors more as a textbook excerpt, with describing various kinds and that's about it. They also don't go further, as is done in later papers, to create simulations or provide real-world synthesis of this kind of circuit.
