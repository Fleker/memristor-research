# [TEAM: ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor Model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6353604)
_Published January 2013_

## Notes
- Very clearly reading these papers backwards, since I read VTEAM earlier
- TEAM: ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor model
    - Based on internal math and not any specific memristor chemistry
    - Mean error of 0.2%
    - See other paper (“Verilog-A for memristors models,”) for Verilog-A model
- Some math and discussions on windows
    - There's some discussion that the ends cannot be fully modeled
- Simmons tunnel barrier is best model for TiO2
    
## Summary

The authors in this paper defines a SPICE simulation model for a current-controlled memristor and compares it with alternatives to show good results.

## Pros

This paper is used as the first step in further research and development including the V-TEAM model later on. The authors put a lot of math in this paper in order to explain their points effectively. Though I didn't examine that segment of the paper in a lot of depth, it is rather thorough. The author's use of clear graphs also leads to a high-quality.

## Cons

I cannot see any real cons of the paper. It's just really solid.
