# [IMPLY-based High Speed Conditional Carry and Carry Select Adders for In-Memory Computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148800)

## Notes
- IMPLY operation
    - Quite good perf improvement
    - Simulations with VTEAM via Cadence Virtuoso
- "Von Neumann bottleneck"
- Carry Select Adder and Conditional Select Adder using IMPLY logic

## Summary
The authors put together a simulation of memristors performing addition behaviors using IMPLY logic. They demonstrate their circuit with a number of different permutations to show strong performance.

## Pros
The authors do a good job of examining various hypothetical circuits in order to really examine their proposed memristor-based circuit.

## Cons
The proposal is simply for an adder circuit in isolation without considering use in common computational applications. Additionally, they don't consider physical benefits such as reduced physical size and only briefly consider energy consumption.
