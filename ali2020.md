# [Memristive Computational Memory Using Memristor Overwrite Logic](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9160878)

## Notes
- Memristor Overwrite Logic (MOL)
- `Qn+1 = Qn A + Qn !B + A !B = M3(A, !B, Qn )`
- A 3-way majority function
- Simulate with MTJ (magnetic tunnelling junction) and 65nm CMOS
- Cadence Virtuoso
- Does better than IMPLY/MAGIC similar systems
- Addition?

## Summary
This paper introduces a proposed logic operation called Memristor Overwrite Logic which uses a combination of memristors and a bit of CMOS (memristor ratioed logic).

Compared to similar systems, IMPLY and MAGIC, simulations show greater performance.

## Pros
The paper is grounded in a literature review, showing the current state of the art and demonstrates an effective incremental improvement.

## Cons
The use of MOL is not quite justified. At least they don't really show its simulation improvements in the scope of a larger architecture and why that might be better.
