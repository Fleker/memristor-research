# [Supporting Legacy Libraries on Non-Volatile Memory: A User-Transparent Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9499947)

## Notes
- Ubuntu 20.04:
  - 6505 libraries
  - Boost, Gnulib, GTK, CPL
    - 5.4m lines of C/C++
    - 342K functions
- PMOPs: Persistent Memory Objects Pools [21-25]
  - Organize persistent data into regions or pools
- Intel PMDK: 128-bit PMEMoid as persistent pointers
  - Similarly is NVHeap
- How to support?
  - Intel spent months updating 7.6% of Redis. Bad time spent.
- Paper goals:
  - No full rewrite
  - Language agnostic
  - Pointer support
  - Minor performance hit
- Proposal: Embed persistence/volatility into pointer address
  - Also a small hardware decoder
- Results:
  - Pure software: 2.75x slowdown
  - Small migration overhead (2%)
  - Requires a simple recompile
- Add new components
  - POT (persistent object table)
  - POLB (Persistent object lookaside buffer)
  - Analogs for NVM
  - Compiler support adds new commands and functionality
    - But doing it just in software just bogs down execution
- Tests (Benchmarks (mostly Boost lib))
  - Linked List
  - Hash table
  - Red-black tree (Self-balancing binary tree)
  - AVL Tree (Databases)
  - Splay tree (garbage collection)
  - Scapegoat tree (self-balancing tree)
  - KNN (MLPack, Armadillo, Boost)
  - Software-only is wildly bad. HW part fixes that to a percentage point.
    - They used a simulated CPU architecture (specs in paper)
  - Also 10% drop in perf for Java programs
- C++ is looking to integrate nvm into their standard >C++21

### Memory addresses
```
01xxx...xxxxxxx...xxx
^^
||____ determines relative or virtual address
 |____ determines NVM or DRAM
 |
 |____ The binary layer then needs to process each address appropriately
```

### Hardware Layer
_See Figure 5_
```
|             | <---> [ STORE P* ] -------|           |         |
| Instruction | <---> [ LOAD UNIT ] <----|---------- | L1 Data |
|             | <---> [ STORE UNIT ] <-> | MEMORY* |  |  Cache  |
|             | <---> [ ARITHMETIC ]     |  UNIT   |  |         |

## Summary
This paper examines what it would take to support non-volatile memory in the large set of existing software libraries with the goal of an automated solution since a full rewrite would be inefficient. Their proposal suggests a compiler modification where dev-inserted pointers could come from various systems and be handled without large lib rewrites.

This software-only solution needs to be paired with a hardware decoding unit to prevent the memory address parsing from becoming too slow. Results suggest only a minor performance hit while allowing these libraries to gain new functionality in the non-volatile memory space.

## Pros
The authors do a good job of examining the problem realistically and developing a workable solution through a simple compiler patch. They go a bit further after seeing the performance hit on their proposal by adding in a hardware decoder to achieve better results. Overall I do like their thought process.

## Cons
In lieu of adding in memory decoders, their approach depends a lot on pointers as the fundamental mechanism for determining volatile or non-volatile. I don't use C often and even in machine learning people typically use Python. So how would you do this in Python? The authors look at other systems in other languages (Table VI) but don't quite consider other language features that may be idiomatic while having other performance hits.

The positive thing is that these libraries need to just be recompiled. But then they seem to have software slowdowns even if all the memory used is volatile. It's hard to justify anyone releasing an update that slows down their software. Could NVM be included without affecting legacy systems?

It also doesn't look at the impact on computing more broadly. You can do linked lists, but that's not a novel use-case. It's a simple recompile not a new programming pattern/paradigm. Here, NVM actually leads to performance slowdown without offering a true benefit. So why adopt it?

In some languages, for some functions, you can wrap an object in another layer (see [Salamander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleker/salamander)) that can provide additional functionality. Alternatively, using [decorators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) can potentially let you augment existing code with new functionality while leaving existing code unaffected.

```javascript
const _db = admin.firestore()
const db = salamander(_db) // Wrap existing objects with new behaviors
```

```javascript
const k = new Set('1');
@nvm const k = new Set('2');
```

```javascript
Array.prototype.push = (...el) => {
  // Do something completely unrelated to array management
}
```

Would any of these really work? Probably not. This may ultimately require capabilities to be baked in at the language-level to fully utilize since JavaScript can't directly touch individual memory addresses.

But could you get a library to run in an NVM virtual machine environment to handle memory if you _only_ wanted NVM? Because that would tell the low-level code how you want the library to behave, with the caveat that everything has to be that way.

```javascript
const db = require('db-lib');
const nvmDb = node.NVM_REQUIRE('db-lib');
```
