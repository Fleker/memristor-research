# [Modeling Biochemical Reactions and Gene Networks with Memristors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8325229)
_Published in 2017_

## Notes
- Cytomorphic Electronics: Circuits that are "ultra low-power", modeled on cell networks
- Cell binding/unbinding reactions can be mapped to binary signals

I dunno. This paper has Kvatinsky as a secondary author but it's way more biology than electronics. I'm trying to read this and it's just not parsing. I'll take the 'L' here.
