# [STT-MRAM-Based Multicontext FPGA for Multithreading Computing Environment](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9462524)

## Notes
- MRAM (magentic) is good for multi-context FGPAs
    - Smaller cell size
    - Nonvolatile
    - Unnecessary to reeconfigure after power cycle
    - Faster than DRAM, same as SRAM
    - Normally poor write perf, but not too big a deal
- Two kinds
    - Thermal-Assisted Switching (TAS-MRAM)
        - Longer read latency
        - Larger area
    - Spinning Transfer Torque (STT-MRAM)
- Nonvolatile multicontext FPGA (NVMC-FPGA) based on STT-MRAM
- Precharged sense amplifier (PCSA)
- Eight circuits on NVMC-FPGA v SRAM-FPGA
    - 15.3% perf to 58% perf
    - 11-80% power to 6-63% power
- Benchmarks
    - Tasks include AES encryption, image processor, FFTs, etc.
    - Yosys logic synthesis and VTR for evaluation
    - And Machsuite

## Summary

Using FPGAs, the authors evaluate their behavior when using SRAM versus nonvolatile memory (STT-MRAM in particular) to show that the latter reduces energy consumption while improving performance across a range of applications.

## Pros

The authors of this paper do a good job of picking a variety of applications. Rather than just saying it works in machine learning and that's it, they really try to explore the computing space and show benefits.

Applications like neural networks (bn4) and packet merge (pm) do a bit better in terms of critical path delay.

This also means that some use-cases such as image processing (cor) and differentials (dif) are worse in that regard.

## Cons

They do accomplish a number of things, but their analysis spends more time focusing on averages rather than highlighting some accomplishments more than others. They generate a lot of graphs and data but then don't provide a lot of discussion on the implications of all this data.

Moreover, the circuits in both cases are largely the same, without considering the second-order design implications of what could be achieved computationally with nonvolatile memory.
