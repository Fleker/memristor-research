# [A Novel Memristive Chaotic System with Hidden Attractors and a Line of Equilibria](https://scientiairanica.sharif.edu/article_23314.html)

## Notes
- Chaos theory: not unstable necessarily but impossible to predict the outcome

## Summary
This paper provides the mathematical underpinning for a chaotic system, then using a memristor as an example of such a system.

## Pros
- This paper introduces a lot of theoretical math to justify its behaviors

## Cons
- The paper is just poorly written in terms of grammar
    - The **Scientia Iranica** is not a journal I'm familiar with
- It ends very abruptly, though that is also due to the format. Figures are added after the conclusion.

abstract = {This paper introduces a newly designed four-dimensional memristive chaotic system. The novel oscillator is chaotic regarding the findings that the system’s dynamic has one positive Lyapunov exponent. Also, due to the results of the equilibrium points analysis, it is shown that the oscillator has a line of equilibria, so the attractors of this system are hidden. Moreover, the study of energy dissipation of this system, power spectrum, and Poincaré sections are conducted to investigate the system's dynamics. The complex features of this system are investigated with the aid of bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents spectra, approximate entropy, and basin of attraction.},
