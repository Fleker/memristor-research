# [A Survey of MRAM-Centric Computing: From Near Memory to In Memory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9927218)

## Notes
- Von Neumann: separate processing and memory does not work well for data-driven applications
    - eg. IoT and autonomous driving
- MRAM: Magnetic Random-Access Memory
    - Better in energy & read time versus RRAM, PCM, and FeFET
    - Takes advantage of tunneling magnetoresistive effect (TMR) for CoFe/MgO-based magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ)
    - Magnet direction usually static with a free layer that can change direction to encode binary data
- Zhang et. al used SRAM with STT-MRAM
    - Reduced energy by 50%, overhead by 32%

- Less energy means less heat
- Other issues:
    - Imbalance b/w capacity and bandwidth in low-power situations
    - Error elasticity
    - Not taking full advantage of the technology
- Potential applications
    - ML and NN
    - Chiu et al proposed high-perf encrypted storage

    - Internet of Things
    - Intermittent Processing w/ energy harvesting and tolerant of power outage
- In-Memory Computing
    - IMC-P: Peripheral Circuits
        - No change to memory array but add extra circuits
    - IMC-A: Memory Array
        - Configure each cell with operations
        - Memory mode to read/write
        - Logic mode where several MTJs in a row become a logic gate (AND/NAND)
            - The relative voltage going through is then rounded and becomes a value
    - Can be done with analog voltage or digital signals (4-8 bit ADCs are common)

## Summary
This paper serves as a literature review of how non-volatile memory can be used for new computing techniques. It explains a variety of research subtopics along with a variety of pros and cons.

## Pros
The paper includes good diagrams and simple explanations, as well as laying out a variety of techniques in the field. They show a variety of applications and areas where more research is needed. It also points to a variety of other papers that I can use to examine each topic in more detail.

## Cons
The paper does a good job of showing variety at the cost of depth. They suggest a number of faults but not how to build around them. They suggest some applications but only at a surface-level without explaining how each would work. They show how it can be useful for future computing paradigms but not how it may work at a software level (and what should be done in software to make them more efficient).
