# [Hybrid Signed Convolution Module With Unsigned Divide-and-Conquer Multiplier for Energy-Efficient STT-MRAM-Based AI Accelerator](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10050403)

## Notes
- AI uses a lot of convolution operations
- Non-Volatile Memory
    - FeRAM: Memory cell size restriction
    - ReRAM: Slow switching speed
    - PCRAM: Poor stability and reliability
    - STT-MRAM looks like the winner here
- Synthesized Nine-Parallel UDC multiplier with Cadence Innovus
- Edge detection application

## Summary
The authors create an STT-MRAM-based neural network accelerator for an edge detection algorithm. The results show a high degree of accuracy as well as a very small amount of energy consumption, touting 22x less than SRAM.

## Pros
The authors did a good job of comparing their work with many others along a series of key metrics.

## Cons
The use of inline math in this paper, which is a math-heavy paper, really makes it difficult to read and understand. As such, their short proposed section really doesn't highlight the paper contributions well. They do show some good contributions but fail to suggest how to make further improvements or scale this reserach more broadly.
