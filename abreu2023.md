## Notes
- It must be noted this is a preprint paper
- Neuro => Brain-like computing
    - ANN: Artifical Neural Networks
    - SNN: Spiking Neural Networks
- Programming model
    - stochastic: Need to be able to handle noise
    - robustness
    - distributedness
    - unobservable
    - physical time
    - analog
- Overall reads like a book chapter
