# [A color image encryption algorithm based on Hopfield chaotic neural network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143816618309497?viewFullText=true)

## Notes
- Composite chaos map for initial key processing
    - Then obtains params for Arnold mapping
    - Scramble image
    - Fnally XOR'd with key to get final ciphertext image
- Hopfield Neural Network: 1982
    - Mainly simulates memory in biological neural networks
    - Output signal fed back as an input for feedback
    - Verified pseudo-random via NIST
- Logistic Chaos Maps
    - Has ergodicity and instability
- Algorithm
    - Uses Arnold cat mapping
    - HNN acts upon the three color chanels
    - Can also be done in reverse for decryption
    - One step is a "confusing process" which might be funny?
- Reference images are Lena (woman), baboon, and peppers
    - Works in color and BW
    - Doesn't work with bad keys
    - Lots of graphs
    - Works reasonably well with an incomplete cipher

## Summary
This paper discusses a Hopfield-based Neural Network for image encryption and decryption which is resilient against data loss but also protective against potential attacks.

## Pros
- A good amount of background material to catch reader up to speed
- Thorough examination of various cases

## Cons
- No discussion on performance relative to other algorithms

abstract = {In this paper, a new chaotic color image encryption algorithm is proposed. This algorithm uses a composite chaotic map combined with a staged Logistic map and Tent map for initial key processing and then obtains the parameters required for Arnold mapping through a function transformation needed to scramble the image. The diffusion phase uses Hopfield chaotic neural network to generate the self-diffusion chaotic matrix, and the key is generated by a function transformation; finally, the scrambled image is XORed with the key to obtain the final ciphertext image. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves encryption efficiency, has good security performance, and can resist common attack methods.}
