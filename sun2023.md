# [Design of General Flux-Controlled and Charge-Controlled Memristor Emulators Based on Hyperbolic Functions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9809981)

## Notes
- Lots of math
- Good set of cases 

## Summary
To achieve a model of a memristor, the authors of this paper create a circuit and then mathematical model that replicates the behavior of a memristor. They show the performance of their model in various conditions.

## Pros
This paper presents a good literature review of previous attempts to develop models of memristors in virtual and physical models. It then proceeds to outline all of the math used to define a circuit that would achieve their desired goals. Thee paper includes a variety of graphs and makes it, while not easy, accessible to understand what's happening.

## Cons
I picked this article as part of a larger analysis of memristor models. However this implementation is more theoretical and mathematical than others of the same kind.
