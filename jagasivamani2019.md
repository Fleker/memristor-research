# [Analyzing the Monolithic
Integration of a
ReRAM-Based Main
Memory Into a CPUâ€™s Die](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8851191)

## Notes
- Put CPU and memory on same die
- Tiled CPUs: Parallelized
- Design with RISC-V
- Potential capabilities: Memory Bandwidth, energy, write endurance, thermal dissipation
- ReRAM cells
    - Optimal at 48% die covered

## Summary
This is a short paper that looks at a CPU die in a VLSI design way to consider how to optimize it in the case that it's embedded with the CPU. It offers some hypothetical benefits without going into any single one mathematically or experimentally.
