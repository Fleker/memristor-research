# [Stateful Logic Using Phase Change Memory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9938984)
_Published at the end of 2022_

## Notes
- Stateful logic is a processing in-memory (PIM) technique
    - Input / output are represented in terms of resistance
    - Output is written directly into cell
- mMPU: _m_emristive Memory Processing Unit
- RACER: Resistance Accelerted Computation for Energy Reduction
    - High performance, compatible with Von Neumann
- Input-Output transfer: three consecutive pulses to perform an AND
- Propose new method to do several logic gates
- IRL tests with a Keysight oscilloscope

## Summary
The use of PCM has not always been effective in performing PIM despite its other good properties. In this hands-on experiment, several logic gates have been created and tested to show that it can actually work well.

## Pros
- Real electrical tests
- Good diagrams and explanations for circuits

## Cons
- Missed opportunity to discuss software implications. Use the same libraries? Update compiler?
