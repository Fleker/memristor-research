# [A Nonvolatile Compute-in-Memory Macro Using Voltage-Controlled MRAM and In Situ Magnetic-to-Digital Converter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10075423)

## Notes
- Analog MAC (Multiply-accumulate) computing w/256 parallel rows
    - 1.5x energy efficiency, 2x density
- One challenge is low ON/OFF ratio
    - In the tens compared to SRAM in thousands
    - Propose new voltage controller

## Summary
This is a relatively hyper-focused article that looks at energy usage foremost within the topic of in-compute memory for nonvolatile memory cells (MRAM) wth specific sections on matters of accuracy and area.

## Pros
The investigation the authors did is quite insightful and detailed.

## Cons
The article, while detailed, does not come to a strong conclusion. They detail a lot of research and math but I don't see how useful the ending is as it doesn't factor deeply into applications.
