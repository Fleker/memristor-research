## Summary

This is a literature review of many kinds of in-memory computing, with a particular focus on small low-energy IoT applications. Serveral kinds of PIM techniques are discussed, as well as a few machine-learning kinds of architectures using non-volatile memory.

## Pros

The paper does a good job going into depth in various technologies, including diagrams and some tables to show the information. And of course there are back-references to learn more.

## Cons

Like [the other review](joshi2023.md) from the same authors, they don't critically analyze any of these technologies or propose some kind of evaluation framework to properly compare them. At the end of the paper there is a table of sorts but the comparison criteria is not consistent. Some method spent to bring it into consistency would be useful for readers going forward.
