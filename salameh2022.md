# [Superconductive Logic Using 2ϕ—Josephson Junctions With Half Flux Quantum Pulses](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9743564)
_Published in 2022_

## Notes
- JJ (Josephson Junctions)
    - Promising for better supercomputing/cloud computing
    - Could operate at 770 GHz with inter-die comms of 100 GB/s
- RSFQ: Rapid Single-Flux Quantum
- ERSFQ: Energy-Efficient RSFQ
- eSFQ: Energy-Efficient Single-Flux Quantum
- JJ limitations
    - Cannot stack efficeintly or densely
    - 2φ-JJ remove the inductors to enable this
- You can turn these into logic circuits
- Simulate with Cadence Virtuoso
    - Measure latency and energy for three logic circuits
    - They do better
    
## Summary
The authors discuss a Josephson Junction and how to use them to create certain logic gates in order to achieve performance improvements.

## Pros
The data seems fairly promising.

## Cons
The paper is too short in my opinion. Having never heard of JJ, the paper does not include a lot of background material either and I found it hard to follow with the long paragraphs and the wide use of acronyms. Perhaps some background papers would help me figure things out.
