# [A Low-Latency and High-Endurance MLC STT-MRAM-Based Cache System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9761996/authors)

## Notes
- STT-MRAM: Spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM
- Advantages
    - Multilevel cells
- Disadvantages
    - Two-step write
    - High write energy
    - Long latency
    - Lifetime issues
- Can we fix? Existing work:
    - High area overhead
    - No write latency fix
- Proposal: EOSwrite (enhanced one-step)
    - 7% area overhead
    - 34% dynamic energy reduction
    - 37% latency reduction
- MLC: Multilevel cell - two magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJ) in one cell
- Data compression technques
    - Line bypassing
    - Intraline encoding
- Uses Gem5 simualtor

## Summary
This paper looks at ways to optimize STT-MRAM usage through encoding and memory management techniques to perform writes instantly instead of performing a read and then a write as is typical. These techniques lead to large improvements in performance compared to similar systems.

## Pros
The introduction in this paper does a very brief justification for why STT-MRAM should be considered for next-gen memory compared to both volatile and non-volatile options, then proceeds to identify ways to optimize this memory while minimizing area usage.

## Cons
While the authors pick STT-MRAM for its relative advantages to other NVM systems, they don't prove it out in their research. Even unoptimized, how would phase-change memory compare to optimized STT-MRAM? The multilevel aspects are interesting but not thoroughly explored for the broader implications in computing. The focus was narrow when it would've been useful to see a broader set of results.
