# [A Simulation Framework for Memristor-Based Heterogeneous Computing Architectures](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9716051)

## Notes
- SPICE simulation
- MBAs (Memristor-based accelerator)
- Existing architecture sims
  - ie. gem5, ZSim do not provide interfaces for MBAs
  - Some exist ie. MNSIM and NeuroSim
    - Designed for electrical properties and not architecture sims
  - Simulations require high-level abstractions that MBAs can take advantage of
  - MBA sims do not support floating-point numbers
- Paper contributions:
  - CPU + MBA via extending ZSim and NeuroSim
  - MHSim
    - > general-purpose and open-source simulation framework for benchmarking all real-world applications in the heterogeneous computing architecture
    - Use dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI)
    - Hook matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) to be offloaded to MBA
- Benchmark
  - 20-500x perf improvement

## Summary
Looking at the state of architecture simulators, particularly with regards to neural network applications, the author threw together a few simulators to get one that worked best for memristor accelerators to great effect.

## Pros
The code for how to do this is on GitHub and the setup is decently documented. They mention in the paper that they can achieve arbitrary binary execution through dynamic binary insertion but don't quite explain how that works entirely. It's not readily clear how to extend it.

The paper does a good job of reviewing the state of things, identifying limitations, and making an improvement with high-yield results.

## Cons
While the authors discuss generic programs they focus their results solely on neural networks. Their simulation software throws everything together in one repo rather than setting up a series of modules or patches that better explain their contributions to the software. The software they used, if not already known by the reader, is not introduced with a lot of context.
