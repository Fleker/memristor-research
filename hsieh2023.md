# [A Nonvolatile Ternary-content-addressable-memory Comprising Resistive-gate Field-effect Transistors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168947)

## Notes
- nv-TCAM: Nonvolatile Ternary-Content-Addressable-Memory
- RG-FET: Resistive-Gate Field-Effect Transistor
- Match is 100 nW and under 2 uW for no-match
- STT-MRAM can be employed with downsides
- So RG-FETs can be employed instead

## Summary
Content-addressable memory using novel NVM transistor design

## Pros
The authors of the paper define a specific problem and effectively deliver with results.

## Cons
The diagrams and graphs presented in the article are way too small. This forces the text to be at odd angles and sizes which make it hard to understand. Additionally, they did not spend a lot of time on the background of CAM and how it should be implemented. Without much background on the topic, I had difficulty reading this paper.
