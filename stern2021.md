# [Sub-Nanosecond Pulses Enable Partial Reset for Analog Phase Change Memory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9474440)
_Published in 2021_

## Notes
- PCM: Melt squelch prevents a gradual reset
    - "Amorphization"
- Partial amorphization via analog reset can be faster than usual
    - 50 intermediate states
    - In this format, standard reading drift no longer occurs

## Summary
This is a short paper, only three pages, to announce preliminary results of an experiment they conducted. They show promising results.

## Pros
I am not familiar with amorphization behaviors in PCM and it was surprising to learn about it as a flaw in the material. That they have developed a workable solution is good.

## Cons
The authors did not really explain a lot of the problems in their background. Throwing around terms like "melt squelch" with little context did not make it easy to understand. Additionally, the results do seem a bit preliminary.
