# [An FPGA-Based Hardware Emulator for Neuromorphic Chip With RRAM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8588383)

## Notes
- Resistive RAM for neuromorphic chip
- RRAM useful with spiking neural networks (SNNs) to be efficient
    - Can be readonly, do matrix math fast
- Disadvantages
    - Prodution defects
    - Dynamic switching variation: cycle-to-cycle variation
- Design SNN based on crossbar RRAM on an FPGA
    - Xilinx and written in Verilog

## Summary
This paper investigates potential hazards in SNNs based on RRAMs through an FPGA model trained on MNIST. By introducing noise, they can see performance drops in accuracy which can be beneficial for the future of tuning both software and fabrication.

## Pros
The paper analyzes faults in a realistic way and uses FPGA logic to simulate. They pick a real dataset for training and show the value of SNNs generally. They also show the advantages of it over CPU-alone simulations.

## Cons
The FPGA model does not appear to be publicly available for reproduction. The authors develop these simulations but don't propose methods of error correction. Yes latch-ups and noise are bad, but are there ways to mitigate this somehow? The simulation could've been extended with more trials or perhaps more datasets to see if certain ML concepts are more or less resilient.
