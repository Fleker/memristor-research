# [Design of CMOS Memristor Emulator and Logic Gates For Neuromorphic Circuits](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10153559)

## Notes

- Optimized w/ 3 MOSFETs and a MOS cap

## Summary

Unlike previous memristor models, the authors of this page present a new one that is similar in performance and output.

## Pros

The authors do a reasonable job laying out the pros and cons of their proposed circuit architecture.

## Cons

The authors highlight some of the flaws but don't really address them. For one, the data retention notable in memristor circuits will not be present here because it's MOSFETs. They say this is an acceptable limitation but don't really discuss further potential architectural improvements.
