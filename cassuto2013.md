# [Sneak-path constraints in memristor crossbar arrays](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6620207)
_Published in 2013_

## Notes
- Basically a risk of bit-flips due to the circuit construction
- This paper has a bunch of math theories and lemmas to characterize the sneak paths but admittedly lost my interest
- Probably followed up by the "Write Sneak-Paths" paper
