- Section 2A has simple mathematiacal models for its chaos

- Consider real-world replication with FPGAs or analog circuits
    - Use +/- 15DCV system using MULTISIM 14.0
- Image encryption demo
    - Scheme
        1. Sequence generator: Create set values of params and states and then do Runge-Kutta and generate secret keys
        2. Permutation: Generate permutation box using chaotic key sequence
        3. Substitution: XOR permuted pixel with second key to get output pixel
    - Cool graphs: Shows nothing but noise and a fairly flat histogram
         - Also perform a correlation analysis and yeah it's got high entropy and low diagonals
    - Initial params and states can actually serve as a decryption image (and figures demonstrate this)
        - Decryption still works even when peppered by noise

## Summary
This paper introduces a working bidirectional cryptography system using memristors with a specific application of encrypting/decrypting simple BW images

## Pros
- Good graphs. Very high-quality.
- The authors are very thorough in fleshing out their application end-to-end

## Cons
- Seems structurally more complicated than [Perach 2019](perach2019.md)
- There wasn't any test of performance or comparisons with contemporary systems
    - Also the images were just grayscale which may make sense for print but it would be interesting to test that aspect
