# [A High-Performance and Scalable NVMe Controller Featuring Hardware Acceleration](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9453406)

## Notes
- Want to improve botleneck by pushing NVM ops to dedicated hardware rather than firmware
    - ex. Intel Optane SSD
    - Past examples have read well but write slow and write w/low bandwidth
- Proposal: OSS ultralow latency, high-bandwidth NVMe controller
    - Impl w/ FPGA
- I/O command manager pushes memory ops to different subsystems
    - Global register file that knows NVMe registers
    - NVMe Admin Module to manage NVMe operations/commands
- Test
    - Real-world FPGA simulates this
    - Does a few benchmarks of data writes/reads with parameters
    - Low power usage while getting good perf almost always

## Summary
This paper doesn't address memristors directly but focuses more on specific non-volatile memory architectures and existing problems with throughput. They published an open source project written mainly in VHDL that enables improved performance for both reads and writes.

## Pros
One big pro is that the project's code is open source and available for hardware simulations and that they really found a particular problem and proposed an effective solution.

## Cons
One con is that the paper's focus was mainly focused on just memory I/O and throughput instead of evaluating the memory in a real-world application, one area they acknowledge for future work. When running a real program, where memory calls can happen in certain patterns or have singular moments of high throughput (opening a file) are there any potential issues with their design? Can we still get a bottleneck or reduced performance in scenarios that are not just steady-state I/O?

The authors also do not compare to non-NVM systems in their benchmarks which I think could've made a compelling reason to use NVM to start with.
